		  		<h3>You probably know that braille is a system of raised dots. Braille letters are made up of up to six dots, arranged 2 wide by 3 deep. This efficient system creates 63 unique character combinations, called braille cells, plus an <q>empty</q> cell representing a space or other formatting.

		  		When learning braille, students and teachers refer to specific dots positions by numbers. From top to bottom, the left row of dots is numbered 1, 2 and 3. The right row is 4, 5 and 6. So, a letter a is called <q>dot 1,</q> while a z <q>dot 1 3 4 6.</q> This is useful when learning how to type braille: the left hand types dots 1, 2 and 3, while the right hand typing 4, 5, and 6.</h3>
